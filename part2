 Project: Autonomous Parcel Delivery Robot

Overview
Designing a Two Wheeled Self-Balancing Robot (TWSBR) to autonomously deliver parcels involves integrating LiDAR for mapping and obstacle detection, and using a PID controller for balance. The robot will navigate using ROS with A* for path planning, ensuring efficient and safe delivery.

 Hardware Components
- LiDAR Sensor**: Provides 360-degree environmental scanning.
- IMU: Ensures balance and orientation.
- Motor Driver: Controls movement and balance.
- Onboard Computer**: Processes LiDAR data and runs algorithms.
- Battery**: Powers the robot throughout its tasks.

 Software Components
- ROS: Manages sensor data, control algorithms, and communication.
- SLAM Algorithm: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping for mapping the environment.
- Path Planning (A*): Optimizes route based on obstacles.
- PID Controller: Maintains balance while navigating.

Implementation
1. Sensor Integration: Utilize ROS to process LiDAR and IMU data.
2. Algorithm Development: Implement SLAM for mapping and A* for path planning.
3. Control System: PID controller ensures stability during movement.
4. Testing and Optimization: Simulate and iterate in controlled environments for efficiency and safety.
