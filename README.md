# Two Wheeled Self-Balancing Robot (TWSBR) with Autonomous Navigation
Project Overview
This project involves the design, enhancement, and programming of a Two-Wheeled Self-Balancing Robot (TWSBR) capable of autonomous navigation. The robot is designed to balance on two wheels using advanced sensor technologies such as gyroscopes and accelerometers. It can carry out various tasks, such as personal transportation or last-mile delivery, by navigating through complex environments.
